# Cache
This is a simple disk and memory cache. It can cache basic swift type such as `String`, `Array`, `Dictionary`, `Image`, `NSData`, numbers (`Int`, `Float`, `Double`, ...) ... It also can cache your custom classes, as long as those class inherit `NSObject` and implement `NSCoding`.

### Why use this cache library
There are many reasons why you should use this cache  libary:  

- Easiest, simplest way to cache, store data.
- Fast responding time. Instead of waiting for load data from Internet, now you can load from cache before update from remote resource.
- Load from cache, just update from remote source when cache expired, can save Internet data (especial 3G data) for users, it can help improve battery life.
- It stores data on disk and memory. When you read cache, it try to get data from memory first. That make reading speed is fast. It auto clean mem cache when RAM is full, so it doesn't make your app out of memory.

### Compatibility
- iOS 9 or later (if you want to use it on iOS 7, you can add files manually)
- Swift 5 (for earlier Swift version, please use earlier DataCache version)

### Usage
#### Cocoapod
Add below lines to Podfile:  

```
use_frameworks!

pod 'DataCache'
```

Note: If above pod doesn't work, try using below pod defination in Podfile:  
`pod 'DataCache', :git => 'https://github.com/huynguyencong/DataCache.git'`

#### Manual
Add all file in folder `Sources` to your project. 

#### Simple to use
Use default cache a create new cache if you want. With each cache instance, you can setup cache size and expired time.
##### Cache and Read an object

Cache object such as `String`, `Array`, `Dictionary`, your custom class (inherite `NSObject` and implement `NSCoding`), ...  

NOTE: With `UIImage`, read next section.

- Write:

```
let myString = "Hello Cache"
DataCache.instance.write(object: myString as NSCoding, forKey: "myKey")
```

or use a utility method for  `String`, `Array` or `Dictionary` to avoid casting to `NSCoding`:
```
DataCache.instance.write(string: myString, forKey: "myKey")
```

- Read:

```
DataCache.instance.readObject(forKey: "myKey") as? String
```

You can use some utility methods to avoid casting step (`as?` keyword): `readString(forKey:)`, `readArray(forKey:)`, `readDictionary(forKey:)`. With other types, please use `as?` to cast object to your type.

##### Cache and Read an image

```
let image = UIImage(named: "myImageName")
DataCache.instance.write(image: image!, forKey: "imageKey")
```

```
let image = DataCache.instance.readImage(forKey: "imageKey")
```

##### Cache and Read a NSData

```
let data = ... // your data  
DataCache.instance.write(data: data, forKey: "myKey")
```

```
let data = DataCache.instance.readData(forKey: "myKey")
```

##### Clean cache

You can clean by key, or clean all, use one of below methods:
```
DataCache.instance.clean(byKey: "myKey")
DataCache.instance.cleanAll()
```
It also clear cache after expiration day. The Default expiration day is 1 week. If you want to customize expiration, please create your customized cache by below instruction. 

##### Custom a class for cache ability
Inherite `NSObject` and implement `NSCoding` protocol with constructor `init(coder:)` and `encode(with:)` method

```
open class MyObject: NSObject, NSCoding {
    open var name = ""
    open var yearOld = 0
    
    override init() {
        
    }
    
    public required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
        self.name = aDecoder.decodeObject(forKey: "name") as! String
        self.yearOld = aDecoder.decodeInteger(forKey: "yearOld")
    }
    
    open func encode(with aCoder: NSCoder) {
        aCoder.encode(self.name, forKey: "name")
        aCoder.encode(self.yearOld, forKey: "yearOld")
    }
}
```

##### Create custom Cache instance

Beside using default cache `DataCache.instance`, you can create your cache instances, then you can set different expiration time, disk size, disk path. The name parameter specify path name for disk cache.

```
let cache = DataCache(name: "MyCustomCache")
```
